1) Decentralization: Blockchains aim to create a decentralized network where there is no central authority or single point of control. This allows for greater security, transparency, and trust among participants.
2) Distributed Ledger Technology: Blockchains use a distributed ledger technology where each participant has a copy of the ledger and can update it in real-time. This ensures that all participants have the same information and can trust the data stored on the blockchain.
3) Blocks and Chains: Blockchains use a chain-like structure where each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with a timestamp and a batch of new transactions or data. This creates an unbreakable chain of blocks that is virtually impossible to alter or delete any previous data.
4) Validation: Blockchains are designed to be tamper-proof, as each block is validated by a network of nodes or participants before it is added to the chain. This ensures that only valid transactions and data are added to the blockchain.
5) Transparency: Blockchains offer transparency, as all participants have access to the same information and can view and verify any transaction or data on the chain. This transparency ensures that there is no need for intermediaries, as participants can trust the information stored on the blockchain without having to rely on a central authority or third-party.
